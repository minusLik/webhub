# Web Hub (need a better name)

  ## Description
  
  The Web Hub is a redirection service where users enter a code and get redirected to another webpage (Example: "git" leads to this repo). Its purpose is to provide some kind of cloud-based bookmark library where links can be shared without tech just by passing the codes. 
  
  ## Feature wishlist
  
  * Code access via URL (e. g. minuslik.com/code/git), serving as an URL shortener.
  * No immediate redirection so that users can check the URL they're being forwarded to
  * Optional password protection
  * multi-language support (EN, DE, BY)
  * LCARS-style UI
